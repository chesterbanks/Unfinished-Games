            <h4 class = "game-text">Doctors vs. Burgers</h4>
            <p><i>Doctors vs. Burgers</i> a collaboration between myself and Captain. The main character was a burger who had to escape from the evil doctors so he could get back to his homeland. There were four "worlds" in the game - Desert Drylands, Volcanic Highlands, Cloudy Skylands, and finally, Doctor's Dielands. It was recieved pretty well, people enjoyed both the gameplay and the graphics (and some liked the crazy story).<br></p>

            <p><i>Knight Monkey</i> was my second game made for Khantober 2016. It had elements from Capture the Flag, tower defense games, and dodge games, all mashed-up in a monkey-themed game. The main character was Knight Monkey, and the player controlled both this character to steal coins from robots as well as where to place guards to protect his own coins. <br><br></p>

            <h4 class = "game-text">River Raid</h4>
            <p><i>River Raid</i> was my entry to Pamela's Retro Game Contest. It was based on an old arcade game by the same name, but I updated the graphics a bit and added my own touches. The player had to fly a plane across the River of No Return without getting hit by enemy helicopters, running out of fuel, or hitting the river bank. Although the game didn't win the contest, people still liked it.<br><br></p>

            <p><i>Descent</i> was my fourth and final game made for Khantober 2016.

            <p><i>Multi Click</i> was a game built around a simple idea - the player controlled five characters at once, clicking to switch their directions and avoiding the edges and falling bombs.

            <h4 class = "game-text">The Little Hexagon</h4>
            <p><i>The Little Hexagon </i> was my first endless runner. The player controlled a hexagon-shaped character through dangerous terrain, jumping over buzzsaws and ducking under overhangs.
